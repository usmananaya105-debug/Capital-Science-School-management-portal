# Ahad School Management System

## Start the application

1. Install Node.js 20 or newer.
2. From this folder, install the dependencies listed in the included `package.json`:

   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Express server (equivalent commands):

   ```powershell
   node server.js
   # or: npm start
   ```

4. Open <http://127.0.0.1:3000> in a browser. Do not open `index.html` as a `file://` URL; the browser app and API must be served by Express.

The server creates `school_system.db` and a default **Main Campus (MAIN)** branch on first start. Existing SQLite records are migrated into Main Campus; browser data is not imported.

Default initial access:

- Email and password: `msaadusman091@gmail.com` / `123456`
- Role PINs: Administrator `Saad1029`, Teacher `Saad2405`, Accountant `Saad1322`, Student `Saad1321`, Shopkeeper `Saad1321`

Self-service email sign-up creates a restricted Student account; it cannot grant Administrator access.

If recreating the project manifest manually, run `npm init -y`, then `npm install express better-sqlite3 cors googleapis` before starting the server.

The server listens on the loopback interface by default. For a reverse-proxy deployment, bind with `HOST=0.0.0.0`, set `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to a comma-separated list of exact browser origins (for example `https://school.example`), and set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` when HTTPS terminates at the proxy. Do not use a wildcard CORS origin with credentialed sessions. Set `ADMIN_INITIAL_PASSWORD` before first start to override the seeded administrator password; this only applies when the default administrator account is first created. Change the seeded role PINs in the application settings before exposing the system.

## Ahad AI (Ollama)

Install and start Ollama locally, then download the configured model (default: `llama3`) with `ollama pull llama3`. The AI assistant sends prompts through the authenticated `POST /api/ai` endpoint to `http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate`; set `OLLAMA_MODEL` before starting the server to use another installed model. The backend-to-Ollama request is server-to-server, so browser CORS settings such as `OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*"` are not required. Requests time out after 30 seconds and return a retry/service-check message. Common Urdu-script navigation phrases are normalized and handled locally before Ollama is called.

The dashboard microphone uses the browser Web Speech API (`ur-PK`) for English/Urdu-mixed voice input and shows interim transcripts. Voice commands use `POST /api/ai` with `mode: "intent"`; the backend asks Ollama for constrained JSON intents. Supported actions include permitted page navigation, preparing a student-add form for Administrator/Branch Admin review, and a read-only absent-students-today report. A student record is not saved until a user reviews the form and presses Save. Speech recognition requires a supported browser, microphone permission, and a secure context (localhost is supported).

## Google Sheets integration

1. In Google Cloud, enable the Google Sheets API and create a service-account key. Store the JSON key outside this project directory; do not upload it through the browser or commit it.
2. Configure the server with either `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` pointing to that private JSON file or `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` containing the JSON. For example, in PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "C:\SchoolSecrets\google-service-account.json"
   npm start
   ```

3. Share the destination spreadsheet with the service account's `client_email` and grant it Editor access.
4. In Settings → Google Sheets, enter the spreadsheet ID or full URL, choose per-module auto-sync toggles, and save. Use **Sync All Sections Now** for a full export. The service account and key stay on the server; the browser receives only credential status.

The spreadsheet contains separate tabs for Students & Admissions, Admissions, Attendance, Timetable, Fees & Financial Ledger, Exams/Gradebook/OBE, Paper Builder/Datesheets, Staff, Parents, Events & Notices, and Branches. A full sync refreshes the base tabs with all branches. A section-level export refreshes a separate branch-suffixed tab so it does not overwrite another branch's export. Export rows carry the branch ID and record type; nested record data is serialized as JSON. Authentication secrets and image data are excluded. Auto-sync is disabled by default and can be enabled separately for each module.

## Storage and API

The browser uses an in-memory state cache backed by authenticated Express requests; it does not use browser storage for school records or sessions. SQLite stores module state and projects students, gradebook marks, fees, and attendance into queryable tables. Passwords and role PINs are salted and hashed; the session cookie is HttpOnly and the API is authenticated.

Available endpoints include:

- `POST /api/ai` for authenticated Ollama assistant requests
- `GET /api/analytics/predictive` for authenticated, branch-scoped school risk, fee forecast, attendance trend, and class-subject performance insights
- `POST /api/auth/login` and `POST /api/auth/logout`
- `GET /api/branches`, `POST /api/branches`, `PUT /api/branches/:id`, `DELETE /api/branches/:id`
- `POST /api/branches/active` to change the centralized administrator's active branch
- `GET /api/branches/overview` for centralized branch performance and fee totals
- `GET /api/users`, `POST /api/users`, `PUT /api/users/:id` for assigning staff accounts to branches
- `GET /api/students`, `POST /api/students`, `DELETE /api/students/:id`
- `GET /api/gradebook`, `POST /api/gradebook`
- `GET /api/datesheets`, `POST /api/datesheets`
- `GET /api/fees`, `POST /api/fees`
- `GET /api/attendance`, `POST /api/attendance`
- `POST /api/attendance/scan` to atomically record student check-in, check-out, bus boarding, or drop-off scans; returns the student, timestamp, current status, and a simulated guardian-notification message
- `GET /api/attendance/status` for current branch-scoped gate/bus status and the latest event times
- `GET /api/transport/routes`, `POST /api/transport/routes`, `PUT /api/transport/routes/:id`, `DELETE /api/transport/routes/:id` for branch-scoped bus routes and student assignments
- `GET /api/state`, `PUT /api/state`, `DELETE /api/state`
- `GET /api/integrations/google-sheets/status`, `PUT /api/integrations/google-sheets/settings`
- `POST /api/integrations/google-sheets/sync-all`, `POST /api/integrations/google-sheets/sync-module`

Branch-aware data endpoints accept `branch_id` in the query string or request body. Centralized Administrators can select any branch or review overview totals; branch administrators, teachers, and other staff are restricted to their assigned branch. Existing records are backfilled to Main Campus during schema migration. The Settings → Branch Management screen supports creating/editing branches, reviewing branch totals, and assigning branch-scoped staff logins. The Datesheet & Roll Slips workspace saves schedules per active branch, class, section, and exam term; each schedule supports reporting and paper start times. Its printable templates use the active school's branding and branch address, include weekday and DD-MM-YYYY dates, and provide board-style datesheets and one-page-per-student roll slips with candidate details, OMR roll-number guide, instructions, and signature/stamp areas.

The Paper Builder saves its header, logo, watermark, font, MCQ layout, and marks-display choices with the draft. Section titles, instructions, and ordering are also editable; changes update the A4 preview and carry through to printing.

The dashboard's Predictive Analytics widgets use SQLite-backed student, gradebook, fee-payment, and attendance data. Student warnings use explicit thresholds (attendance below 75%, latest numeric score below 50%, or a decline over 20 percentage points). The next-month fee estimate is the mean of the previous three completed months' recorded collections; it is a simple historical estimate, not a guarantee. Overall health and class/subject summaries are deterministic indicators, not an AI model's diagnosis.

Attendance includes an authenticated gate kiosk for camera QR/barcode scans and USB/RFID readers that submit a student ID followed by Enter. ID cards print both CODE128 barcodes and QR codes containing the student's ID. Administrators and Branch Administrators can configure bus routes and student assignments; teachers can record scans, and bus actions require the assigned route. Events are timestamped in SQLite, update the daily attendance record, and refresh dashboard and Parents Portal status displays every 30 seconds. The notification is simulated in the response and UI; no SMS, WhatsApp, or push provider is configured, and the Parents Portal remains the existing staff-facing linked-record view.
